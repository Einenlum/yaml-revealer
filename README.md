# Yaml Revealer

**Yaml Revealer** is a vim plugin which allows you to handle the full tree structure of a Yaml key.

If you often use Yaml files, you know they are very readable at the beginning, but also that they can become a bit harder to read when becoming longer and longerâ€¦ **Yaml Revealer** is here to guide you when you're lost.

## Features

### Reveal the full tree structure of a key

    myRoot:
        firstChild:
            myVar: "foo"
        secondChild:
            myVar:
               foo: "foo"
            myVar2:
               foo: "foo"
               bar: "bar"
    >          specialKey: "Hi"

Moving to the indicated line will automatically make vim echo

    myRoot > secondChild > myVar2 > specialKey

### Search for a specific key

Typing `:call SearchYamlKey()` will display a prompt to search a specific key.

    Search for a Yaml key:

Searching for

    myVar2>specialKey

will find the concerned line.
